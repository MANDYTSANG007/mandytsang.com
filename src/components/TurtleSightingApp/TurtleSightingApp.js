                    <p>Turtle Explorer is a mobile app and website designed to promote sea turtle conservation by encouraging users to report sightings of sea turtles. The primary target audience is anyone who cares about sea turtle conservation. The app is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their age or level of knowledge about sea turtles.</p>

                    <h2>Client's Need</h2>
                    <p>Turtle Explorer has an outdated website and app. They want to improve their exisitng app and provide a website that allows users to easily report turtle sightings. This will help them gather important data on turtle populations and better understand the needs of the turtles in the area. It will also provide an opportunity to engage with the community and raise awareness about turtle conservation efforts.</p>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>Turtle Explorer has an existing app and website, but they lack a key feature of allowing users to report turtle sightings. This is a major problem for the organization as they rely on this data to monitor the turtle population and track their movements.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="section">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>I undertook a redesign of their website and app, ensuring a clear hierarchy and intuitive user flow for users. To facilitate the report sighting process, I incorporated process indicator features, presenting users with easily understandable and distinct steps. In contrast to a traditional form layout, this approach ensures a streamlined user experience. Furthermore, the new design is responsive, enabling users to access the report sighting feature from any device.</p>
