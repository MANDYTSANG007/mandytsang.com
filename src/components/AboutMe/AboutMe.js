            <h1>Hello, I'm Mandy</h1>
            <p> Greetings and welcome to my profolio page! I'm a full-stack developer and a UX designer who designed and coded this site using a popular web development library called React. I bring a unique perspective of technical and creative skills to my work. But my interests don't stop there - you can often find me tinkering with DIY projects or brewing up a mean cup of coffee.</p>
            <br />
            <p>With my diverse skill set and never-ending curiosity, I love tacking challenging projects and bringing them to life. I'm a firm believer in the power of perfect balance between form and function, and strive to achieve it in my works.</p>
            <br />  
            <p>As you browse through my projects, please keep in mind that this site is always evolving, just like my skills and passion for creating innovative solutions. Whether you're interested in collaborating on a project or simply want to learn more about my work, I hope you find this page informative and inspiring. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
