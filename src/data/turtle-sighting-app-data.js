This will help them gather important data on turtle populations and better understand the needs of the turtles in the area. It will also provide an opportunity to engage with the community and raise awareness about turtle conservation efforts."

To facilitate the report sighting process, I incorporated process indicator features, presenting users with easily understandable and distinct steps. In contrast to a traditional form layout, this approach ensures a streamlined user experience. Furthermore, the new design is responsive, enabling users to access the report sighting feature from any device."
